title:"BGSA positions to be filled!"
categories:event
---

Hey BGSA!
 
Thanks to everyone showing up to our BGSA information night last Thursday! I think we generated a lot of interest in some positions we have yet to fill.  One correction: we only have one WIPS position that needs to be filled.  More information will follow about the election process, but here is a list of positions where NO ONE has even expressed interest in:

- AGSEM (TA union reps, 2 positions)
- PGSS
- Green Committee
- Secretary

So think about those! Feel free to email me with any questions in the meantime before the elections get underway. I’m also looking for someone to organize a Staff Appreciation Day in May if you are interested.
 
Also note that there are several upcoming events! A science writing seminar next week, our monthly coffee hour next Wednesday, and the BGSA General Assembly is scheduled for May 3rd! Hope to see you at all of them!
